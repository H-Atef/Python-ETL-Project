# Python Project for Data Engineering

## Project Overview

This course project focuses on applying some Data Engineering and Python skills. The project involves working with real-world financial data to perform data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.

## Project Description

The primary goal is to compile a list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. The project involves accessing, transforming, and storing this data in multiple currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, INR) based on provided exchange rates.

## Objectives

1. **Data Extraction**: Access relevant data that lists the largest banks and their market capitalization in billion USD.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Convert market capitalization values into multiple currencies using exchange rate information in a CSV file.
   - Prepare the data for easy access.
3. **Data Loading**:
   - Save the transformed data as a CSV file locally.
   - Load the data into a database table for efficient querying.

## Key Steps

1. **Research and Data Gathering**: Identify the top 10 banks and their market capitalization figures.
2. **Handling Exchange Rates**: Use the provided CSV file containing exchange rates for currency conversion.
3. **Data Formatting**: Structure the transformed data for analysis.
4. **Local Storage**: Save the processed data as a CSV file.
5. **Database Implementation**: Insert the data into a database for easy access.

## Expected Outputs

- A CSV file containing the top 10 largest banks with market capitalizations in USD, GBP, EUR, and INR.
- A database table that stores the same information for easy access.
